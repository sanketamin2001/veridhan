            <p class="p">
                Futures and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially
                lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing one’s
                financial security or lifestyle. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk
                capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

            <h3 style="font-size:20px;margin-bottom:10px;">Hypothetical Performance Disclosure</h3>
            <p class="p">
                Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are described below. No representation
                is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown; in fact, there
                are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved
                by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally
                prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no
                hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk of actual trading. For example, the
                ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses are material points
                which can also adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in
                general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation
                of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect trading results.
